# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

This calculator project is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It features a clean and intuitive interface with buttons for digits, operators, and functions like delete and reset. Additionally, the calculator offers a theme switcher, enabling users to toggle between light and dark modes for a personalized experience.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Theme Switcher**: Users can choose between light and dark themes to suit their preferences.
- **Persistent Theme Setting**: The selected theme is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the user's preference is retained across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator's layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator and its elements.
- **CSS**: Styling of the calculator, including the layout, colors, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for performing calculations, handling user interactions, and managing theme switching.

## How It Works

### Theme Switching

The calculator allows users to switch between light and dark themes using a range input. The selected theme is applied immediately, and the preference is saved in the browser's local storage. This ensures that the chosen theme persists even when the user closes and reopens the browser.

### Basic Calculations

Users can input numbers and select operators to perform calculations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The result of the calculation is displayed on the screen. Users can also use the delete button to correct any mistakes and the reset button to clear all inputs and start a new calculation.

## Future Improvements

- **Complex Calculations**: Adding support for more complex calculations, such as handling multiple operations in a single expression and implementing operator precedence.
- **Additional Features**: Introducing more advanced mathematical functions and a history feature to keep track of previous calculations.

## Notes

This project was an opportunity to explore various aspects of web development, including user interface design, event handling, and state management with local storage. Implementing the theme switcher was a particularly interesting challenge that added a dynamic aspect to the calculator. This project served as a valuable learning experience in building interactive web applications.
